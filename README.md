# Lassen Fly Shop - AWS/Next.js

## Author

Guy Farley

## Problem Domain

The purpose of this simple eCommerce-style application is to deepen my understanding and skillset in two areas:

1. Use of the **Next.js** framework to build a front end application. Primary goals:
    - Become familiar with navigation between *pages* using the `<Link>` component
    - Increase my knowledge of built-in support for CSS and Sass in Next.js
    - Make use of pre-rendering and data fetching
    - Implement dynamic routes to render an item-specific page based on user's selection

2. Use of specific **AWS** tools for data management on the back end. Primary goals:
    - To set up an HTTP API through which the front end application can request data
    - To incorporate an AWS Lambda function that will be triggered by front end
    - To store and retreive data from a DynamoDB, sending data back to front end application
